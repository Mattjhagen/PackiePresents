# 🚐 Packie Presents: Our #VanLife Journey

Hey there, awesome internet human! 👋  
We’re Matt & Terra — creators, dreamers, builders, and code-tinkerers documenting our quirky, inclusive, and sometimes chaotic #VanLife adventure.

## 🌈 What We’re Doing

We’ve traded the 9–5 grind for something more meaningful. We're traveling the country full-time in our van, building tools, websites, and content that empower LGBTQ+ creators, small businesses, and tech misfits like us.

Our mission?  
- ✨ Promote trans visibility  
- 💻 Build accessible, open-source web tools  
- 📸 Share honest van life content  
- 🛠️ Tinker with code & creativity wherever WiFi reaches

## 💖 Why We Need Your Help

Living this dream isn’t always easy. Gas isn’t free, nor is mobile data or coffee (sadly). By supporting us, you help fund:

- 📦 Hosting & domain costs  
- 🔋 Power banks, mobile hotspots, and gear  
- 🎥 Content creation & editing tools  
- 🍜 Actual food — noodles are cool but variety is better  
- 🧠 Our peace of mind (priceless)

Even $1/month means the world to us.

## 💸 Support Options

We're accepting sponsors via GitHub & beyond:

[**🌟 Sponsor Us on GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/Mattjhagen)  
[Venmo](https:www.venmo.com/u/PackieMobile)

Every bit goes toward keeping us connected, caffeinated, and coding from our tiny home on wheels.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for caring.  
We hope to see you on the road or in the terminal. 💻🚐
