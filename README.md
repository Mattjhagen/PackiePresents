# 🚐 Packie Presents: Our #VanLife Journey

Hey there, awesome internet human! 👋  
We’re Matt & Terra — creators, dreamers, builders, and code-tinkerers documenting our quirky, inclusive, and sometimes chaotic #VanLife adventure.

## 🌈 What We’re Doing

We’ve traded the 9–5 grind for something more meaningful. We're traveling the country full-time in our van, building tools, websites, and content that empower LGBTQ+ creators, small businesses, and tech misfits like us.

Our mission?  
- ✨ Promote trans visibility  
- 💻 Build accessible, open-source web tools  
- 📸 Share honest van life content  
- 🛠️ Tinker with code & creativity wherever WiFi reaches

## 💖 Why We Need Your Help

Living this dream isn’t always easy. Gas isn’t free, nor is mobile data or coffee (sadly). By supporting us, you help fund:

- 📦 Hosting & domain costs  
- 🔋 Power banks, mobile hotspots, and gear  
- 🎥 Content creation & editing tools  
- 🍜 Actual food — noodles are cool but variety is better  
- 🧠 Our peace of mind (priceless)

Even $1/month means the world to us.

## 💸 Support Options

We're accepting sponsors via GitHub & beyond:

[**🌟 Sponsor Us on GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/Mattjhagen)  
[Venmo](https:www.venmo.com/u/PackieMobile)

Every bit goes toward keeping us connected, caffeinated, and coding from our tiny home on wheels.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for caring.  
We hope to see you on the road or in the terminal. 💻🚐

## 🧰 Build Your Own Site from a Resume (For Free!)

We created an AI-powered tool that turns your resume into a slick, professional one-page website — no coding required.

### 💡 Why It Matters

Your resume *isn't* just a PDF anymore. With a personal site:
- You **stand out** in hiring pipelines
- You look more **professional and modern**
- You’re easier to **Google**, share, and impress

### ⚙️ Features

- **Upload your resume (.pdf, .txt, .docx)**
- **Instantly generate** a personalized About Me site
- **Free subdomain** (like `yourname.pacmac.me`)
- **Optional domain purchase** with Google Workspace email
- You keep full control — **no logins or paywalls required**

### 💸 Bonus Perk

When someone buys a domain or adds Google Suite through your site, *you get a referral reward*. Spread the love, earn some digital coffee money ☕.

👉 Try it now on [PacMacMobile.com](https://pacmacmobile.com) under **“Build Your Digital Presence.”**

## 🧠 How It Works: AI-Powered Resume Parsing + Personality Themes

When you upload your resume, we don’t just slap your name on a template — we let AI **read it like a recruiter** and **build your personal brand** into the design.

### 📄 Parsing the Resume

Our backend uses AI to:
- Extract your **name**, **experience**, **skills**, and **education**
- Summarize your **background** into a clear, compelling intro
- Organize everything into a clean, web-ready layout

### 🎨 Matching Your Vibe

Instead of cookie-cutter templates, our system:
- Analyzes keywords and tone from your resume
- Applies a **theme that fits your personality** (e.g. minimalist for engineers, bold and bright for creatives)
- Lets you tweak colors, fonts, and layout if you want to fine-tune

### 🌐 Result?

A unique, mobile-friendly About Me page that feels *like you* — not just your résumé.

**Example:**  
Upload a resume that says *“ethical hacker + minimalist”*, and you'll get a dark-themed, terminal-style page.  
Upload one that screams *“creative marketer + traveler”*, and you’ll get bold fonts, vibrant colors, and maybe a 🌍 emoji or two.

### 🚀 What’s Next

We’re expanding to let users:
- Choose from AI-curated themes
- Link to their portfolios and socials
- Share their page with a free subdomain or custom domain

> *Because your story deserves more than a PDF.*
